      "Okay, the user wants a haiku about programming. Let me start by recalling what a haiku is. It's a traditional Japanese poem with three lines. The syllable structure is 5-7-5. So first line 5 syllables, second 7, third 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Programming themes... Maybe focus on the essence of coding. Think about elements like code, logic, problem-solving. Maybe use imagery related to computers or programming concepts. Let me brainstorm some words: loops, bugs, syntax, logic, debug, compile, code, errors, algorithms, binary, circuits, keyboard, screen, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "First line: Maybe something about the process. \"Code flows like rivers\" – that's 5 syllables. Rivers as a metaphor for continuous flow of code. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second line needs 7 syllables. Maybe something about debugging or solving problems. \"Debugging shadows hide\" – wait, that's 6 syllables. Let me adjust. \"Debugging shadows hide truths\" – that's 7. Or \"Debugging shadows in code\" – 6. Maybe \"Debugging shadows creep\" – 6. Hmm. Alternatively, \"Logic threads through circuits\" – 6. Wait, maybe \"Debugging shadows hide\" is 6. Maybe \"Debugging shadows hide truths\" – 7. That works. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third line: 5 syllables. Maybe something about the outcome or the satisfaction. \"Logic blooms\" – 4. \"Logic blooms in light\" – 5. Or \"Errors fade to zero\" – 5. Or \"Syntax finds its way\" – 5. Let me see. If the first line is \"Code flows like rivers,\" second \"Debugging shadows hide truths,\" third \"Logic blooms in light.\" That seems to fit. Let me check syllables again.\n",
      "\n",
      "First line: Code (1) flows (1) like (1) rivers (2) – total 5. Yes. Second line: Debugging (3) shadows (2) hide (1) truths (1) – total 7. Third line: Logic (2) blooms (1) in (1) light (1) – 5. Yes. That works. Alternatively, maybe \"Errors fade to zero\" as the third line. Let me think which one is better. The first version has a more poetic feel with \"logic blooms in light.\" It suggests that through debugging, the logic becomes clear and shines. Alternatively, \"errors fade to zero\" is more about fixing errors. Both are good. Maybe the first one is more metaphorical. Let me go with that. So the haiku would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Code flows like rivers,  \n",
      "Debugging shadows hide truths—  \n",
      "Logic blooms in light.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Does that capture programming? It mentions coding, debugging, and the resolution of logic. Maybe \"shadows hide truths\" refers to hidden bugs or issues that need to be found. The imagery connects programming challenges with natural elements. I think that works. Let me check if there's a better way to phrase the second line. Maybe \"Debugging shadows creep\" but that's 6 syllables. Alternatively, \"Debugging shadows conceal\" – 6. Hmm. \"Debugging shadows hide truths\" seems okay. I think this haiku is good. Let me make sure there's no forced rhyming, but haikus don't require rhyme. It's more about imagery and syllable count. Yeah, this should work.\n",
